# 📈 Progressive Chat — Android

A Matrix client in the making. The goal: a truly progressive messenger with a **pure C++ native** core.

Currently an active fork of [Element](https://github.com/element-hq) Classic ([element-android](https://github.com/element-hq/element-android)). Kotlin/Java/Rust components are being gradually replaced with native C++ — starting with real features.

🚀 **Rocket-speed development** — a full Matrix client implemented in months, not years. 170+ C++ native modules and counting.

**Website:** [progressive.chat](https://progressive.chat)

## The Vision

- **Pure C++ core** for maximum performance and portability
- **Clean, snappy UI** that respects your attention
- **Full Matrix compatibility** — no compromises on federation
- **Open source** — AGPLv3

## AI Agent (`/agent`)

Progressive Chat includes an LLM-powered agent system — like Claude Code for your chats.

```
/agent find messages from Alice about the future
/agent summarize what happened since yesterday
/agent search for any mentions of "meeting" and tell me who said what
```

The agent can:
- **Read** your chat history
- **Search** messages by keyword
- **Send** and **edit** messages
- **List** room members and their profiles
- **React** to messages with emoji
- **Navigate** between rooms and DMs

**How it works:**
1. You write `/agent <task>` in any room
2. The C++ `agent_executor` module builds a system prompt with room context + available tools
3. It sends the request to your configured LLM (OpenAI / Anthropic API)
4. The LLM can call "tools" (read messages, search, etc.) to gather information
5. The agent loop continues until the task is complete or max iterations reached
6. Results are displayed in the room

**Configuration:** Set your LLM API endpoint in Labs → LLM Settings.

**C++ modules used:** `agent_executor` (orchestrator), `llm` (API calls), `slash_command` (parsing)

## Building

Standard Android build with NDK/CMake for native C++:

```bash
./gradlew assembleFdroidDebug
```

CI builds F-Droid arm32 (armeabi-v7a, works on all devices). Requires Android SDK, NDK 21.3+, CMake 3.22+.

## System Requirements

- **Minimum:** Android smartphone with **1 GB RAM**
- Exact memory requirements will be precisely determined as the C++ native core matures — current figures are preliminary and may be revised
- Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer

## How You Can Help

Progressive Chat is in active development. We have months of debugging and polishing ahead before the first stable release. Here's how you can contribute:

- **Test and report bugs** — run the F-Droid debug APK, use the features, and open issues
- **C++ code review** — all native modules in `progressive/src/main/cpp/` welcome scrutiny
- **Kotlin integration** — JNI wrappers are ready, UI wiring needs love
- **Translations** — help localize the growing list of labs settings
- **Documentation** — improve setup guides, feature descriptions
- **Spread the word** — tell your Matrix friends about `progressive.chat`
